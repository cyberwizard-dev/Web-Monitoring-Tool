A lightweight and efficient tool designed for monitoring website uptime and downtime. This tool periodically checks the
status of specified websites and generates detailed reports. In the event of a downtime, it captures a screenshot of the
website, logs the HTTP status code, and sends an email alert with the report, including relevant details like response
time, content length, and a snapshot of the issue. Ideal for ensuring continuous website availability and receiving
immediate notifications when a site goes down.
